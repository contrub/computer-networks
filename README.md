# Course Project: Computer Network Design

## Overview  
This project involves designing a computer network that includes multiple branches and production units. The goal is to create a reliable, scalable, and secure network infrastructure to support efficient management of manufacturing, logistics, and retail operations.

## Features  
- Design of a structural and logical network diagram with VLAN segmentation  
- Selection and justification of active and passive network equipment  
- Configuration of security measures: NAT, VPN, DMZ, wireless access with WPA2  
- Network simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Implementation of network security and monitoring solutions

## Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer - for network modeling and testing  
- VLAN, VPN, NAT, DMZ - technologies for access control and security
